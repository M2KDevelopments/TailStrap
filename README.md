# TailStrap
TailStrap UI is an npm package that extends the Bootstrap look and feel by adding new UI components and features to the existing Bootstrap library. However, unlike traditional Bootstrap extensions, TailStrap UI is built on top of Tailwind CSS, which makes it more lightweight and customizable.

TailStrap UI provides a set of reusable UI components that are designed to work seamlessly with Tailwind CSS, allowing developers to create modern and responsive web applications quickly and easily. These components are fully customizable and can be easily integrated into any web project.

In addition to the standard Bootstrap components, TailStrap UI also includes new and enhanced components that are not available in the core Bootstrap library. These components include advanced forms, tables, and data visualization tools that enable developers to create more complex and powerful UIs.

TailStrap UI is also designed to be highly modular, allowing developers to pick and choose which components they want to use in their projects. This makes it easy to create custom UIs that meet the specific needs of each project.

Overall, TailStrap UI is a powerful and flexible UI library that extends the Bootstrap look and feel, while also being more lightweight and customizable than traditional Bootstrap extensions. With its comprehensive set of tools and highly modular design, TailStrap UI is the ideal choice for developers looking to create modern and responsive web applications.
